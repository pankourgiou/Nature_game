You will have to put the .html file plus the images on the same folder...copy-paste the .html on your notepad and save it as .html...my home-village is full of such pictures full of trees and clean air...very beautiful village--->the idea is we should be protecting nature more, we should be proactive with nature and respect her, many things might not change through this .html file but our possibilities of succeeding something woulf be 0% if we were just non-active...enjoy!
